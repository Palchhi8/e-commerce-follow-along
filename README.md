# Milestone 12: My Products Page

## Overview
In this milestone, we will create a "My Products" page that displays all products added by a user based on their email. We will accomplish this by writing a backend endpoint to fetch products from MongoDB filtered by the user's email and dynamically displaying them on the frontend using the previously created product card component.

## Learning Goals üéØ
By the end of this milestone, you will:

- Learn how to write an endpoint to filter and send data from MongoDB based on a user's email.
- Understand how to fetch and receive data on the frontend.
- Display data dynamically using a product card component.

## Steps to Complete Milestone 12 üìù

### Backend:
1. **Create an endpoint** in your backend application that retrieves all products associated with a user's email from MongoDB.
2. **Filter products** based on the email provided in the request.
3. **Send the filtered data** as a response to the frontend.

### Frontend:
1. **Write a function** to fetch the filtered product data from the backend.
2. **Process the received data** and pass it to the product card component.
3. **Dynamically display** the products on the "My Products" page.

## Notes
- This lesson will help in understanding how to filter data based on specific constraints and send it to the client efficiently.
- Ensure proper error handling for scenarios where no products are found for a given email.

## Next Steps
- Enhance the UI with better styling and user experience.
- Implement pagination if needed for better performance.
- Add authentication checks to ensure only the logged-in user's products are displayed.

  - Add Product
  - Cart
- Make the Navbar responsive.
- Add the Navbar to all pages for easy navigation.

This milestone teaches how to build and reuse a responsive Navbar for seamless navigation.

### Milestone 16: Product Info Page

In this milestone, we will create a page to display product details, choose quantity, and add to the cart.

#### Key Tasks:
- Create a page to display product data.
- Add a quantity selector.
- Implement an "Add to Cart" button.

This milestone focuses on building a functional product info page for users.

- Create an endpoint to handle requests from the cart page.  
- Fetch all cart products using the user's email.  

This milestone focuses on implementing backend logic to retrieve cart items efficiently.

### Milestone 19: 
## Cart Page

The cart page allows users to view their selected products and modify quantities using `+` and `-` buttons. Each product's name, price, and quantity are displayed. The quantity updates in real-time as users interact with the buttons. The backend provides a `PUT /cart/update` endpoint that handles quantity adjustments. It accepts a request body with `productId` and `newQuantity`, and responds with the updated cart. This feature ensures users can easily manage their cart before checkout. The cart page is fully integrated with the backend for smooth functionality and up-to-date data display.

### Miestone 20:
 ## Profile Page

The profile page allows users to view and manage their personal information. The backend provides a `GET /profile` endpoint to fetch user data, including profile photo, name, email, and address. The frontend displays the profile information in two sections: one for personal details (photo, name, email) and another for the address. If an address is available, it is shown; otherwise, the message "No address found" appears. An "Add Address" button is included for users to add their address. This feature helps users view and edit their profile in a simple, user-friendly interface.

### Milestone 21 - Address Form Implementation
